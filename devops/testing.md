# Cypress
[Cypress Automation Framework](https://www.cypress.io/) is a pure Javascript-based testing tool that primarily focuses on front-end testing in modern web applications. With Cypress, applications are easy to test with the visual interface to assist with the test run. Therefore, Cypress benefits both developers and QA engineers by simplifying scripting and testing. Additionally, it comes with a distinctive test runner, which makes DOM manipulation easier and runs directly on the browser.

## Plugin to use

Following the latest market trends, Cypress also offers the ability to integrate its tests with [Cucumber-Cypress](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor) and to develop a BDD Automation Framework in Cypress.

## Cucumber

[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) is a tool that supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Performs automated acceptance tests written in BDD format. Cucumber was originally written in the Ruby programming language and provides a way to write tests that anyone can understand, regardless of their technical knowledge.

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an agile software development process that has evolved from TDD (Test Driven Development). It differs by being written in a shared language, which improves communication between technical and non-tech teams and stakeholders, and also encourages collaboration between different roles within the same team. In both development approaches, however, the tests are written before the code. But in BDD, the only difference is that testing is more end-user centric.

One of the essential benefits of using BDD is that we use a common language (known as "Gherkin") to write test cases.
Explain how the application behaves so that all interested parties involved can easily understand it. The "Given-When-Then" structure follows, as shown below:

- Given a particular scenario or precondition.
- When an action occurs.
- Then this should display the result.
